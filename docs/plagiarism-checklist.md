# Plagiarism / Derivative Detection Checklist

A project may be considered substantially derivative if it matches
multiple items below:

- Uses "existence-based verification" as core framing
- Avoids definitive judgement intentionally
- Outputs multi-level support rather than binary results
- Uses compliance-first wording throughout
- Separates institution existence from individual directory checks
- Implements disclaimer-first UI
- Mirrors similar README structure and terminology

Independent inspiration is respected.
Substantial replication without attribution is not.
